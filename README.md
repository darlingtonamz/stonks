# Stonk Project
## Dependencies
- [Docker](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-20-04)
- [Docker-Compose](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-docker-compose-on-ubuntu-18-04)
- Make - `sudo apt-get install build-essential`

## First time setup

1. Create necessary docker networks:
```bash
docker network create nginx_proxy
```
2. Run [nginx proxy](https://github.com/nginx-proxy/nginx-proxy)
```bash
# note: --restart=always restarts the container automatically after reboots
docker run -d -p 80:80 --name=nginx-reverse-proxy --network=nginx_proxy --restart=always -v /var/run/docker.sock:/tmp/docker.sock:ro jwilder/nginx-proxy
```
3. Setup `VIRTUAL_HOST` entries in you hosts file
```
# on Linux - /etc/hosts
# on Windows - C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc

host$ > sudo nano /etc/hosts

# - Add the following line to your `hosts` files
127.0.0.1       api.stonk.local
```

## General usage

### Project
* Create a copy of `secret.yml.example` and rename it to `secret.yml`
* Run `make build`
  * The image is built and stored locally
* Run `make run`
  * Starts up all the services defined in the `docker-compose` files and keeps the process open in the current terminal
  * Running `make run-d` will start a detached process
  * Monitoring the logs can help debug startup issues or programming errors, either by not starting a detached process, or by tailing the STDOUT/STDERR with `make run logs`
```
host$ > make run

# or

host$ > make run-d
```
* Refer to the content of the `Makefile` for other useful commands


## Finally
After configuring your VIRTUAL_HOST, and running `make build && make run` in the root folder of the project.

Backend app will be accessible on http://api.stonk.local or http://localhost:8080

To test that it is working go to <HOST>/health

# Usage
Please checkout `api/example.http` for all the endpoints required in this exercise.

To use the `api/example.http` file on VSCode, please install the [Rest Client (humao.rest-client)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client) extension.

I opted to use `UUID` instead of `integer` as a `id` reference for `[Users, Trades, and Stocks]`


## Extra
### Connecting to containers
* Run `make connect service=<service>`
  *  The `service` must be the name defined in the docker-compose files, e.g. `api` or `database`.
* To test the `api`
  * Connect to the running service 
  * Run the `test` yarn command in the `api` container
  ```
  # from project-root directory
  
  host $ make connect service=api
  /app # yarn run migration:run
  /app # yarn run test
  ```

## Things to improve on
- Authentication of `Users`
- Authorization of `Users`
- Full CRUD for all Major Entities [`Trades`, `Stock`, `Users`]
  - currently:
    - `Trades` [Create, Read]
    - `Users` [Create, Read]
    - `Stocks` [Create, Read]
- Add Linting Fix with ESLint
- Configure testing through `make test` using proper `docker-compose.test.yml`
- Reformating strings payloads with trailing spaces in Request.body
- Implement a `BaseController` - To abstract some of the bloat in the current controllers
- Unit test for the `StocksService -> getStockStats(...)`
- On Delete User -> Cascade-Delete User Trades
